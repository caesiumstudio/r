Raga Des is a musical scale or mode in Indian classical music. It is a raga that is performed in both the Hindustani (North Indian) and Carnatic (South Indian) classical music traditions. However, it's important to note that there are differences in the way ragas are approached and interpreted in these two traditions.

In Hindustani classical music, Raga Des is often associated with the evening hours. The scale of Raga Des may vary, but it typically includes the following swaras (notes): Sa, Re, Ma, Pa, and Dha in the ascending order (Arohana), and Dha, Pa, Ma, Re, Sa in the descending order (Avarohana). It is a pentatonic raga, meaning it uses a five-note scale. Raga Des is known for its evocative and emotional character.
