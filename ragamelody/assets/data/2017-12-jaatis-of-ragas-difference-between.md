### A Raag is nothing but a selection or a combination of specific Swaras from the Saptak.

Later the musicologist Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande classified Ragas in 10 specific Thaats (For more information see: Thaats)

There are certain Ragas in which all the Seven Sounds (Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni) are used and such Ragas are called “Complete Ragas”.

There are certain other Ragas in which only Six or Five swaras are used.

The sounds (Swaras) which are not used are called Varjit Swara or Prohibited Sound.

Such Ragas with Six Sounds are called **Sharav Raag**.

There are certain Ragas in which only five Sounds are used. Such a Raag is called Auruv Raag.

All in all, the Ragas can be classified in Jaatis (Castes) based on the Number of Swaras whereas Thaats are a classification technique based on the Type of the Swaras.

There are mainly Nine castes (Jaati) of Ragas as explained below:
