### Introduction
Raag Malkauns (a.k.a Malkosh) is a very popular raga in the North Indian System (Hindustani Classical Music). In the South it is known as Hindolam. It is a pentatonic raga that has five notes Sa, Ga(k), Ma, Dha(k), and Nn(k). One would think that with so many komal (flat) notes, it would have a strong minor quality about it. However, upon close examination we see that the absence of the fifth and the strong presence of the fourth causes the mind to "invert" it. Therefore, it tends to sound surprisingly similar to Dhani to which it has a murchana relationship.
