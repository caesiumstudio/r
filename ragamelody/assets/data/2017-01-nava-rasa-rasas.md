### Karuna
Karuna, is pathetic, tearful, sad, expressing extreme loneliness for either god or love.

### Raudra
Raudra, is fury or excited anger. This rasa is often used in drama, but in music it can portray the fury of mature degree as in a thunderstorm. Musically it can be shown through many fast, 'trembling' ornaments, producing a scary vibrating effect in the lower ranges of instruments.

### Veera
Veera, expresses the sentiments of heroism, bravery, majesty and glory. A dignified kind of excitement.

### Bhayanaka
Bhayanaka, is frightening or fearful. It is difficult to express in music through one instrument though it can be managed in an ensemble or vocally.

### Shanta
Shanta is the last rasa and shows peace, tranquility and relaxation.
